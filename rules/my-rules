#  such may be abused to blacklist certain words even spelled correctly.
# capitalize is case sensitive, and also bracketed by non-word.
# phrase and spelling are case insensitive, but bracketed by non-word characters.
# syntax is case sensitive but not bracketed by non-word; probably best if used with regexes.
et al\.[^}]          % syntax use the \etal{} command instead. (or write one to italicize)
et\. al\.            % syntax use the \etal{} command, "et" needs no dot. (or write one to italicize)

\ban [b-df-gj-np-tv-z] % syntax probably meant to use "a" instead of "an", though there are exceptions.
\ban [B-DF-GJ-NP-TV-Z][^A-Z] % syntax probably meant to use "a" instead of "an", though there are exceptions (like acronyms).
\b[Aa] [aeiouAEIOU](?!ser|ni|A) % syntax probably meant to use "an" instead of "a", though there are exceptions. (user, AA, unified, uniform, unique; n/a doesn't work, so use {n/a})
\\caption\{[^}]{60,}  % syntax such a long caption should have an abbreviated caption in square brackets

including [^\.]*etc\. % syntax "including" tells of a non-exclusive list, so "etc." is redundant.  This rule will misfire if you have two lists in your sentence, but you shouldn't do that either. ;)

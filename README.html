    <title>How to use the style checker</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Why does this code exist?</h1> This code is a weapon
    against collaborators who would dilute your writing with
    ambiguous or verbose prose.  It is designed to ensure that
    collaborative papers appear in a consistenst style: mine.

    <p>I think of all activities as coding.  My presentations
    use python scripts, not powerpoint.  My writing and
    research posters use latex and emacs, not word or
    publisher.  When I write code, I try to be creative and
    sloppy, relying on tools to identify most of my
    mistakes.  (For example gcc issues warnings, splint can
    verify some memory processes, custom scripts can
    identify simple portability problems, etc.)  When
    writing text, I had no such tools.

    <p>The style checker is one such tool.  When I make a
    mistake in my work that can be identified by a regular
    expression, or notice one in papers I read, I add a
    forbidden expression to the style checker's ruleset.
    Then, when I build my latex-formatted paper, I run the
    style checker to seek out such phrases.

    <p>It has saved me from submitting gramatically-sloppy
    last-minute edits.

    <p>Like the warnings printed by a compiler, errors from
    the style checker should not be taken literally.  Use
    your own judgement to correct sentences: make them
    shorter, more specific, more varied.

    <h1>How does it work?</h1> The style checker is a ruby
    script that seeks out files in directories
    /etc/style-check.d or ~/.style-check.d, or files named
    ~/.style-censor or ./style-censor.  Each file is a list
    of expressions in one of four types, annotated with a
    justification.  See the existing files for examples.
    
    <h2>Type 1: Syntax</h2> Syntax expressions are matched
    exactly. They are case-sensitive.  Any regular
    expression will do.  As a hint "\b" will match some
    non-word character, like a space or newline.

    <h2>Type 2: Capitalize</h2> Capitalize expressions match
    whole words, and are case-sensitive.  Such expressions
    are designed to help maintain uniformity of
    capitalization of product and project names, like
    PlanetLab, Scriptroute, CoDeeN, iPod, etc.  They are
    transparently wrapped with "\b"s to ensure that only
    whole words are matched.

    <h2>Type 3: Phrase</h2> Phrases match longer phrases
    such as "the foreseeable future". As with capitalize
    expressions, they are transparently wrapped with "\b"s,
    but are not case sensitive.  Some phrases that should
    be forbidden include double words.

    <h2>Type 4: Spelling</h2> Spelling expressions are
    internally handled just like phrases.  These are useful
    for common misspellings or typo's.  Perhaps you habitually
    misspell lose as loose and would prefer to have a checker
    complain.  I habitually misspell measurment, secrurity,
    and experiements.

    <p>The style checker also seeks out common errors within
    the LaTeX source itself: <ul> 

      <li>an unescaped percent-sign directly following a
    number is frequently an error.</li>
      <li>a \cite{} tag should precede a period.</li>
      <li>a \cite{} tag should not be used obviously as a noun in 
        the middle of a sentence.</li>
      <li>paragraphs should end with the end of a sentence.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Comments using \begin{comment} and \end{comment} from 
    comment.sty are skipped.

    <h1>How do I use it?</h1> 

    <tt>style-check.rb *.tex</tt>

    <p>Or, if you'd like to see the method behind the madness,<br> 
    <tt>style-check.rb -v *.tex</tt>

    <h1>Limitations</h1> This is not a proof-reader, editor,
    spelling checker, or grammar checker.  It can catch only
    some simple, common, frustrating mistakes.  It is not a
    substitude for reading what I've listed below.  It is intended
    only for LaTeX files.

    <p>This code will not teach you to use "that" and
    "which" properly.  It will not teach you to hyphenate.
    It may be used for evil.  You may think my rules are
    stupid.

    <p>There are many bugs in the code; it is not guaranteed
    that the style checker will find all forbidden phrases.

    <h1>Further Reading</h1> This section is split into two
    categories -- entertainment for reading that is light
    and fun and should help you think about writing better,
    and reference that may help answer harder questions.

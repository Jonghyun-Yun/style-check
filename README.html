    <title>How to use the style checker</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>Why does this code exist?</h1> 

    <p>This code is a weapon against collaborators who would
    dilute your writing with ambiguous or verbose prose.  It
    was designed to ensure that collaborative papers appear
    in a consistent style: mine.
      
    <p>I think of all activities as coding.  My
    presentations use python scripts, not powerpoint.  My
    writing and research posters use latex and emacs, not
    word or publisher.  When I write code, I try to be
    creative and sloppy, relying on tools to identify most
    of my mistakes.  (For example, gcc issues warnings,
    splint can verify some memory processes, and custom
    scripts can identify simple portability problems.)  When
    writing text, I had no such tools.

    <p>The style checker is one such tool.  When I notice a
    mistake that can be identified by a regular expression,
    I add a forbidden expression to the style checker's
    ruleset.  Then, when I build my latex-formatted paper, I
    run the style checker to seek out such phrases.

    <p>It has saved me from submitting gramatically-sloppy
    last-minute edits.

    <p>Like the warnings printed by a compiler, errors from
    the style checker should not be taken literally.  Use
    your own judgement to correct sentences: make them
    shorter, more specific, more varied.

    <h1>How does it work?</h1> The style checker is a ruby
    script that seeks out files in directories
    /etc/style-check.d or ~/.style-check.d, or files named
    ~/.style-censor or ./style-censor.  Each file is a list
    of expressions in one of four types, annotated with a
    justification.  See the existing files for examples.
    
    <h2>Type 1: Syntax</h2> Syntax expressions are matched
    exactly. They are case-sensitive.  Any regular
    expression will do.  As a hint, "\b" will match some
    non-word character, like a space or newline.

    <h2>Type 2: Capitalize</h2> Capitalize expressions match
    whole words, and are case-sensitive.  Such expressions
    are designed to help maintain uniformity of
    capitalization of product and project names, like
    PlanetLab, Scriptroute, CoDeeN, iPod, etc.  They are
    transparently wrapped with "\b"s to ensure that only
    whole words are matched.

    <h2>Type 3: Phrase</h2> Phrases match longer phrases
    such as "the foreseeable future" or <a
    href="http://www.plainenglish.co.uk/pressrelease.html">"at
    the end of the day"</a>. As with capitalize expressions,
    they are transparently wrapped with "\b"s, but are not
    case sensitive.  Some phrases that should be forbidden
    include double words.

    <h2>Type 4: Spelling</h2> Spelling expressions are
    internally handled just like phrases.  These are useful
    for common misspellings or typo's.  Perhaps you habitually
    misspell lose as loose and would prefer to have a checker
    complain.  I habitually misspell measurment, secrurity,
    and experiements.

    <p>The style checker also seeks out common errors within
    the LaTeX source itself: <ul> 

      <li>an unescaped percent-sign directly following a
    number is frequently an error.</li>
      <li>a \cite{} tag should precede (not follow) a period.</li>
      <li>a \cite{} tag should not be used obviously as a noun in 
        the middle of a sentence.</li>
      <li>paragraphs should end with the end of a sentence.</li>
      </ul>

    <p>Comments using \begin{comment} and \end{comment} from 
    comment.sty are skipped.

    <p>Math mode between unescaped $'s is skipped. 

    <p>For more detail, read the ruby code.  It's shorter
    than this file.

    <h1>How do I use it?</h1> 

    From the style-check-(version) directory, run <br>
    <tt>sudo make install</tt> <br>
    to install as the superuser.  As an alternative, <br>
    <tt>make user-install</tt><br>
     will put the
    ruleset in your home-directory, but putting the
    style-check.rb script in your path is up to you.

    <p>To run the script,<br>
    <tt>style-check.rb *.tex</tt>

    <p>Or, if you'd like to see the method behind the madness,<br> 
    <tt>style-check.rb -v *.tex</tt>

    <h1>Limitations</h1> This is not a proof-reader, editor,
    spelling checker, or grammar checker.  It can catch only
    some simple, common, frustrating mistakes.  It is not a
    substitude for reading what I've listed below.  It is intended
    only for LaTeX files.

    <p>This code will not teach you to use "that" and
    "which" properly.  It will not teach you to hyphenate.
    It may be used for evil.  You may think my rules are
    stupid.

    <p>There are many bugs in the code; it is not guaranteed
    that the style checker will find all forbidden phrases.

    <h1>Attitude</h1>

    <p>Don't ask me to add a feature.  Send me a patch.

    <p>Don't complain that it's written in Ruby.  My
    language kicks your language's ass.

    <p>Don't complain about the ruleset.  Invent a mechanism
    to override ones you don't care for.

    <h1>Further Reading</h1> This section is split into two
    categories -- entertainment for reading that is light
    and fun and should help you think about writing better,
    and reference that may help answer harder questions.

    An effective way to understand the frustration of bad
    writing is to read a pretentious political science text
    asking yourself, "could this be written more clearly?"
